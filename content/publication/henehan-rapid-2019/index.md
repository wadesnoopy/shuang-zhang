abstract: Mass extinction at the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary coincides with
  the Chicxulub bolide impact and also falls within the broader time frame of Deccan
  trap emplacement. Critically, though, empirical evidence as to how either of these
  factors could have driven observed extinction patterns and carbon cycle perturbations
  is still lacking. Here, using boron isotopes in foraminifera, we document a geologically
  rapid surface-ocean pH drop following the Chicxulub impact, supporting impact-induced
  ocean acidification as a mechanism for ecological collapse in the marine realm.
  Subsequently, surface water pH rebounded sharply with the extinction of marine calcifiers
  and the associated imbalance in the global carbon cycle. Our reconstructed water-column
  pH gradients, combined with Earth system modeling, indicate that a partial ∼50%
  reduction in global marine primary productivity is sufficient to explain observed
  marine carbon isotope patterns at the K-Pg, due to the underlying action of the
  solubility pump. While primary productivity recovered within a few tens of thousands
  of years, inefficiency in carbon export to the deep sea lasted much longer. This
  phased recovery scenario reconciles competing hypotheses previously put forward
  to explain the K-Pg carbon isotope records, and explains both spatially variable
  patterns of change in marine productivity across the event and a lack of extinction
  at the deep sea floor. In sum, we provide insights into the drivers of the last
  mass extinction, the recovery of marine carbon cycling in a postextinction world,
  and the way in which marine life imprints its isotopic signal onto the geological
  record.
