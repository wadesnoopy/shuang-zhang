abstract: The boron isotope-pH proxy has been widely used to reconstruct past ocean
  pH values. In both planktic foraminifera and corals, species-specific calibrations
  are required in order to reconstruct absolute values of pH, due to the prevalence
  of so-called vital effects — physiological modification of the primary environmental
  signals by the calcifying organisms. Shallow marine abiotic carbonate (e.g. ooids
  and cements) could conceivably avoid any such calibration requirement, and therefore
  provide a potentially useful archive for reconstructions in deep (pre-Cenozoic)
  time. However, shallow marine abiotic carbonates could also be affected by local
  shifts in pH caused by microbial photosynthesis and respiration, something that
  has up to now not been fully tested. In this study, we present boron isotope measurements
  from shallow modern marine carbonates, from the Bahama Bank and Belize to investigate
  the potential of using shallow water carbonates as pH archives, and to explore the
  role of microbial processes in driving nominally ‘abiogenic’ carbonate deposition.
  For Bahama bank samples, our boron-based pH estimates derived from a range of carbonate
  types (i.e. ooids, peloids, hardground cements, carbonate mud, stromatolitic micrite
  and calcified filament micrite) are higher than the estimated modern mean-annual
  seawater pH values for this region. Furthermore, the majority (73%) of our marine
  carbonate-based pH estimates fall out of the range of the estimated pre-industrial
  seawater pH values for this region. In shallow sediment cores, we did not observe
  a correlation between measured pore water pH and boron-derived pH estimates, suggesting
  boron isotope variability is a depositional rather than early diagenetic signal.
  For Belize reef cements, conversely, the pH estimates are lower than likely in situ
  seawater pH at the time of cement formation. This study indicates the potential
  for complications when using shallow marine non-skeletal carbonates as marine pH
  archives. In addition, variability in δ11B based pH estimates provides additional
  support for the idea that photosynthetic CO2 uptake plays a significant role in
  driving carbonate precipitation in a wide range of shallow water carbonates.
