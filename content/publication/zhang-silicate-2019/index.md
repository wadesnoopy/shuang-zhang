abstract: Silicate weathering provides a stabilizing feedback in the global carbon
  cycle and has played a key role in keeping surface environments clement for the
  majority of Earth's history. It was recently proposed that ophiolite emplacement
  at low latitude at ∼90 to 70 Ma and ∼50 to 40 Ma enhanced the rate of silicate weathering
  and led to global cooling that terminated the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum. In
  this study, we revisit this proposal with a series of models of varying complexities
  to investigate the likelihood that Earth's climate was driven largely by ophiolite
  emplacement in the Paleogene. Our models are constrained by either marine Os isotopic
  records or the combination of carbon cycle, Sr and Os isotopic records, and solid
  Earth degassing rates. The proposed changes in ophiolite weathering are inconsistent
  with our Os isotope mass balance model. With our coupled carbon cycle and weathering
  proxy model, total global silicate weathering fluxes (including ophiolite weathering)
  slightly decreased or remained relatively constant from 52 to 42 Ma. This constancy
  in global silicate weathering fluxes is inconsistent with the idea that enhanced
  ophiolite weathering directly led to global climate cooling. However, our model
  results support the idea that the strength of the silicate weathering feedback (weatherability)
  has played a significant role in regulating the pCO2 levels through the Cenozoic.
  Further, the modeling toolkit developed here can be used to explore the role of
  mafic rock weathering in driving climate change in other intervals through Earth's
  history.
