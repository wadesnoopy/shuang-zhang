abstract: Geological redox proxies increasingly point towards low atmospheric oxygen
  concentrations during the early Paleozoic Era, with a subsequent protracted rise
  towards present-day levels. However, these proxies currently only provide qualitative
  estimates of atmospheric O2 levels. Global biogeochemical models, in contrast, are
  commonly employed to generate quantitative estimates for atmospheric O2 levels through
  Earth's history. Estimates for Paleozoic pO2 generated by GEOCARBSULF, one of the
  most widely implemented carbon and sulfur cycle models, have historically suggested
  high atmospheric O2 levels throughout the Paleozoic, in direct contradiction to
  competing models. In this study, we evaluate whether GEOCARBSULF can predict relatively
  low Paleozoic O2 levels. We first update GEOCARBSULF by adopting the recent compilation
  of the δ13C value of marine buried carbonate and replacing the old formulation of
  the sulfur isotope fractionation factor with empirical sulfur isotope records. Following
  this we construct various O2 evolution scenarios (with low O2 levels in the early
  Paleozoic) and examine whether GEOCARBSULF can reproduce these scenarios by varying
  the weathering/degassing fluxes of carbon and sulfur, or carbonate δ13C. We show
  that GEOCARBSULF can, in fact, maintain low-O2 (even 1–5% atm) levels through the
  early Paleozoic by only varying the carbonate δ13C within 2 standard deviation (SD)
  bounds permitted by the geological record. In addition, it can generate a middle–late
  Paleozoic rise in O2 concentration, coincident with the diversification of land
  plants. However, we also argue that tracking atmospheric O2 levels with GEOCARBSULF
  is highly dependent on carbonate carbon isotope evolution, and more accurate predictions
  will come from an improved C isotope record.
