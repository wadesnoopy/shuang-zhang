abstract: The marine phosphorus cycle plays a critical role in controlling the extent
  of global primary productivity and thus atmospheric pO2 on geologic time scales.
  However, previous attempts to model carbonâ€“phosphorus-oxygen feedbacks have neglected
  key parameters that could shape the global P cycle. Here we present new diagenetic
  models to fully parameterize marine P burial. We have also coupled this diagenetic
  framework to a global carbon cycle model. We find that seawater calcium concentration,
  by strongly influencing carbonate fluorapatite (CFA) formation, is a key factor
  controlling global phosphorus cycling, and therefore plays a critical role in shaping
  the global oxygen cycle. A compilation of Cenozoic deep-sea sedimentary phosphorus
  speciation data provides empirical support for the idea that CFA formation is strongly
  influenced by marine Ca concentrations. Therefore, we propose a previously overlooked
  coupling between Phanerozoic tectonic cycles, the major-element composition of seawater,
  the marine phosphorus cycle, and atmospheric pO2.
