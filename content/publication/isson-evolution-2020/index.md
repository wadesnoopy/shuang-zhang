abstract: The existence of stabilizing feedbacks within Earth's climate system is
  generally thought to be necessary for the persistence of liquid water and life.
  Over the course of Earth's history, Earth's atmospheric composition appears to have
  adjusted to the gradual increase in solar luminosity, resulting in persistently
  habitable surface temperatures. With limited exceptions, the Earth system has been
  observed to recover rapidly from pulsed climatic perturbations. Carbon dioxide (CO2)
  regulation via negative feedbacks within the coupled global carbon-silica cycles
  are classically viewed as the main processes giving rise to climate stability on
  Earth. Here we review the long-term global carbon cycle budget, and how the processes
  modulating Earth's climate system have evolved over time. Specifically, we focus
  on the relative roles that shifts in carbon sources and sinks have played in driving
  long-term changes in atmospheric pCO2. We make the case that marine processes are
  an important component of the canonical silicate weathering feedback, and have played
  a much more important role in pCO2 regulation than traditionally imagined. Notably,
  geochemical evidence indicate that the weathering of marine sediments and off-axis
  basalt alteration act as major carbon sinks. However, this sink was potentially
  dampened during Earth's early history when oceans had higher levels of dissolved
  silicon (Si), iron (Fe), and magnesium (Mg), and instead likely fostered more extensive
  carbon recycling within the ocean-atmosphere system via reverse weatheringâ€”that
  in turn acted to elevate ocean-atmosphere CO2 levels.
