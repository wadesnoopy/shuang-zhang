abstract: Compared with riverine systems, the influence of groundwater on the global
  carbon cycle has remained underexplored. Here, we provide a new estimate of the
  bicarbonate fluxes from fresh groundwater to the ocean by coupling a statistical
  and hydrological analysis of groundwater and river samples across the contiguous
  United States with a study of global groundwater characteristics. We find that the
  mean HCO3 concentration ([HCO3]) in groundwaters exceeds that in surface rivers
  by a factor of 2–3 throughout the contiguous United States. Based on estimates of
  fresh groundwater discharge to the ocean and scaling up our estimated mean [HCO3]
  in groundwaters from the United States and around the world, we arrived at a mean
  global HCO3 flux from groundwaters ranging from 7.4 × 1012 (25th percentile)–1.8
  × 1013 mol/yr (75th percentile) to 2.8 × 1013–8.3 × 1013 mol/yr, which is 22%–237%
  of the global HCO3 flux from river systems, respectively. We also estimated that
  the global carbon flux derived from subsurface silicate weathering could be comparable
  to 32%–351% that from surficial silicate weathering, depending on groundwater discharge
  rates. Despite large uncertainties due to data limitation, this study highlights
  that groundwater weathering could be an important carbon sink in both the short-
  and long-term carbon cycle. Therefore, additional work on groundwaters is needed
  to develop a well-constrained view of the global carbon cycle.
