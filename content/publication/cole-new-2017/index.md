abstract: The enrichment and depletion of redox sensitive trace metals in marine sediments
  have been used extensively as paleoredox proxies. The trace metals in shale are
  comprised of both detrital (transported or particulate) and authigenic (precipitated,
  redox-driven) constituents, potentially complicating the use of this suite of proxies.
  Untangling the influence of these components is vital for the interpretation of
  enrichments, depletions, and isotopic signals of iron (Fe), chromium (Cr), uranium
  (U), and vanadium (V) observed in the rock record. Traditionally, a single crustal
  average is used asa cutoff for detrital input, and concentrations above or below
  this value are interpreted as redox derived authigenic enrichment or depletion,
  while authigenic isotopic signals are frequently corrected for an assumed detrital
  contribution. Building from an extensive study of soils across the continental United
  States – which upon transport will become marine sediments – and their elemental
  concentrations, we find large deviations from accepted crustal averages in redox-sensitive
  metals (Fe, Cr, U, V) compared to typical detrital tracers (Al, Ti, Sc, Th) and
  provide new estimates for detrital contributions to the ocean. The variability in
  these elemental ratios is present over large areas, comparable to the catchment-size
  of major rivers around the globe. This heterogeneity in detrital flux highlights
  the need for a reevaluation of how the detrital contribution is assessed in trace
  metal studies, and the use of confidence intervals rather than single average values,
  especially in local studies or in the case of small authigenic enrichments.
