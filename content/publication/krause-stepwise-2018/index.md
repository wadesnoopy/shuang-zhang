abstract: Oxygen is essential for animal life, and while geochemical proxies have
  been instrumental in determining the broad evolutionary history of oxygen on Earth,
  much of our insight into Phanerozoic oxygen comes from biogeochemical modelling.
  The GEOCARBSULF model utilizes carbon and sulphur isotope records to produce the
  most detailed history of Phanerozoic atmospheric O2 currently available. However,
  its predictions for the Paleozoic disagree with geochemical proxies, and with non-isotope
  modelling. Here we show that GEOCARBSULF oversimplifies the geochemistry of sulphur
  isotope fractionation, returning unrealistic values for the O2 sourced from pyrite
  burial when oxygen is low. We rebuild the model from first principles, utilizing
  an improved numerical scheme, the latest carbon isotope data, and we replace the
  sulphur cycle equations in line with forwards modelling approaches. Our new model,
  GEOCARBSULFOR, produces a revised, highly-detailed prediction for Phanerozoic O2
  that is consistent with available proxy data, and independently supports a Paleozoic
  Oxygenation Event, which likely contributed to the observed radiation of complex,
  diverse fauna at this time.
